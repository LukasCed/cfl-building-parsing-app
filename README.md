# cfl-building-parsing-app
CFL builder (from CFG that are superset of XML rules I guess it's close lol) and parser that builds a DOM (maybe even CFG later). Initially, parser will have defined rules but maybe I'll find a way to inject rules to parse any CFL 

I'm sorry that this is made in JavaScript, just wanted to learn it
